#### This is the introduction part for JavaScript.

I learned how to write a "Hello World" program in JS and the ways to see the output which were:

- With the terminal using **node script.js** command.
- In the browser using the **console** tab in the developer tools option.
  1. It required a HTMl file to run the script.
  2. Linking my **script.js** to the HTML file.
