//?? All about debugging using the developer tools options in the browser by using the breakpoints, errors, call stack

//** Hoisting
console.log(sum(2, 2)) //? Here the function is called before its definition but still it works coz JS hoists the functions at the top so it actually behaves as if the log statement was called after the function definition.

//? This is called hoisting and it is very helpful in writing complex functions

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

//? But it has an exception as well. Only normal functions are hoisted, variables are never hoisted.

console.log(sumArrow(2, 2))

let sumArrow = (a, b) => a + b //? This gives an error "Cannot access 'sumArrow' before initialization at object" which means that the arrow function is called before its definition coz essentially an arrow function is just a variable definition.

//** Scoping
function sayHi(name) {
  let result = "Hi " + name //?Here we are using the same variable twice but the code is working fine without any errors, that's because of scoping of the variables.

  //? The result variable inside the sayHi function has a local scope of just inside the function.
  console.log(result)
}

let result = "Pranjal" //? Whereas, the result variables is scoped globally. So, having different scopes these two are considered different variables in JS.
sayHi(result)

//? A variable in the outer scope is accessible throughout the program but the variale inside the inner scope is not accessible from the outer scope

let c = 3
{
  let a = 1
  //console.log(b)  //? This gives error coz we can't see in from the outside of the scope.
  {
    let b = 2
    console.log(a) //? a & c are accessible from the inner scope
    console.log(c)
  }
}
